# 🚀 Day 9 in My Journey to Learning Everyday! 🚀

Today, I explored the fascinating world of CSS in React, diving into various ways to style components effectively.

What I Learned:

1️⃣ Inline CSS in React

💡 Key Takeaways:
Styles are written as JavaScript objects.
Properties use camelCase instead of traditional CSS syntax.
Ideal for quick, specific styling or dynamic inline styles.

2️⃣ Conditional CSS

💡 Key Takeaways:
CSS can be applied dynamically based on conditions.
Great for toggling styles depending on component states or props.

3️⃣ CSS Modules

💡 Key Takeaways:
Scoped CSS ensures styles don't clash globally.
Perfect for large projects requiring maintainable and reusable styles.

What I Built:
I created a website showcasing movie cards! Each card includes:
🎬 A picture of the movie.
📜 A short description to entice viewers.
This project helped me solidify my understanding of CSS Modules by styling each card individually while maintaining a clean and scalable design.

Why This Matters
Understanding and utilizing these styling techniques empowers me to create visually appealing React applications while maintaining flexibility and scalability.
